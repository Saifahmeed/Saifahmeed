👋 Hello, I'm Saif Ahmed!

🚀 I'm a sophomore at AUC, majoring in Computer Engineering, with a passion for Fullstack development. Currently, I am participating in the 12-month ALX Software Engineering program, where I am gaining valuable knowledge and hands-on experience in various areas of software engineering.

💻 My core curriculum content at ALX includes C programming, graphic programming, Unix programming, data structures and algorithms, reverse engineering and security, Python, front-end development, Linux/command line, and infrastructure design and management. This comprehensive curriculum has equipped me with a solid foundation in software engineering principles and practices.

🌟 One of my notable projects is the Airport Queue Simulation program, a group project where we simulated the randomness of airplane runways using object-oriented programming in C++. This project aimed to optimize passenger flow and enhance overall efficiency in airport queues. I actively contributed to the design and implementation of the program, applying my knowledge of data structures and algorithms to ensure its effectiveness.

🌱 With a keen interest in research and learning, I am always looking for opportunities to apply my skills and contribute to impactful projects. I enjoy solving complex problems and leveraging my expertise in software engineering to develop innovative solutions. 
Fun fact: I play chess ♟️ and basketball 🏀. These activities provide a balance in my life and contribute to my overall personal growth.

📚 As a dedicated learner, I am constantly expanding my knowledge and staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends. I am open to collaborating on exciting projects and eager to connect with like-minded individuals. If you would like to discuss potential collaborations or have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me.
